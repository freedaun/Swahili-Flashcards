# Swahili Flashcards

This is a page which allows you to practice Swahili in a very uncomplicated way, so you can focus on learning. 

You get a simple sentence from one or more categories, and see if you already understand it. 

If you do, click "Remove" or type RightArrow, and the sentence will not repeat. 

If you don't, click "Repeat" or type LeftArrow, and the sentence will come back soon. 

When I don't understand a word I consult an AI to explain the word using the following prompt: 

    Translate to and from Swahili, prefer the kenyan dialect. Add a little bit of grammatical and word explanations.

You can select cards from one or more categories. Progress is reported. 

To add words or sentences, open the file in a text editor, locate 'vocabulary[]' and add your own entries.

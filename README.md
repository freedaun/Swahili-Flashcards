You get a simple sentence from one or more categories, for you to see if you already understand it. 

If you do, click `Remove` or type `RightArrow`, and the sentence will not repeat. 

If you don't, click `Repeat` or type `LeftArrow`, and the sentence will come back soon. 

Then the sentence scrolls up, with a translation added, with a new sentence below. 

When you don't understand a word, consult an AI to explain the word using the following prompt: 

    Translate to and from Swahili, prefer the kenyan dialect. Add a little bit of grammatical and word explanations.

This prefers the Kenyan dialect, because it is simpler. 

You can select cards from one or more categories. Progress is reported. 

Click `Invert` to go from English to Swhahili instead. Type `UpArrow` to hear the card spoken (bad pronounciation). 

To add words or sentences, open the file in a text editor, locate `vocabulary[]`, prompt an AI to give you the data you need and add them as entries. 

Verbs have their root separated by a single quote, to show the conjugation, ex: `ana'lia`. The same was done for nouns when they are modified, like `kazi'ni`. 

Randomization also affects the last 2 categories, Conjugated and Negated, as are generated on the fly for each session. Likewise possessives are randomized in phrases that contain them.
